      - Fix for getting favorite button to toggle:
          - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74754284/iconbutton-selectedicon-not-toggling
      - Now pressing FB on one card toggles for them all
          - After I followed below tutorial for a list of cards with JSON objects,
             the _itemBuilder Widget gets the index of each card in the list
          - I made a boolean list where each index corresponds to whether each card
              is favorited
          - It works!
      - Search bar
          - https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchBar-class.html
          - The leading search icon isn't showing up
      - Looks promising for working with JSON objects
